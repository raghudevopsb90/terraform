# 2. Add an import block with the server id
# 3. terraform plan  -> shows "1 to import"
# 4. terraform apply -> server is now in the state file. The import block can then be removed.

## Don't want to write the resource block by hand?
## Keep only the import block and run:
##   terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
##
## Older CLI way (no import block):
##   terraform import aws_instance.workstation i-0123456789abcdef0
